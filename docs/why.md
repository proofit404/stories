# Why

Good code is easy to understand and change. We build `stories` with
this constrains in mind.

`stories` force you to write structured, understandable code with right
separation of concerns and responsibilities.

Let's consider common troubles you meet in development.

## Micro framework

Micro frameworks don't offer too much structure to your project. The
main goal is flexibility. And you're mostly on your own when it comes to
organizing your code.

Most of the times you will end up with two problems:

1. Long view functions.
2. Lots of `if` statements inside this functions.

There is a lot of complexity in it.

Let's consider following view function.

```pycon

>>> from flask import Flask
>>> app = Flask('app')

>>> @app.route('/subscriptions/')        # 85
... def buy_subscription(page):          # 86
...                                      # ...
...      if props[-1].endswith('$'):     # 121
...         props[-1] = props[-1][:-1]   # 122 <-
...                                      # 123

```

We do not have any information about this strange comparison expression.

Let's consider we should process this data in a different way to
complete our current task.

We decide to change this expression.

Of course, we test all possible scenarios we can imagine.

But after some time this error would happen in the production:

```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "views.py", line 1027, in buy_subscription
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

Turns out there were a lot more variants of incoming data than we can
imagine. So our change failed in several business scenarios.

This happens because our code wasn't written to help us understand it.

## Macro framework

On the other side, there are a lot of technologies with strong opinions
on how to structure programs written with their help.

This approach also has its own cost.

1. You need method flowchart to understand data flow in your system.
2. Zig-zag traceback problem. It's hard to figure out the actual
   execution path because your code always mixed with the code of the
   framework.
3. Framework internals leak into your code base.

Let's consider this view:

```pycon

>>> from rest_framework import viewsets
>>> from django_project.filters import SubscriptionFilter
>>> from django_project.models import Subscription
>>> from django_project.permissions import CanSubscribe
>>> from django_project.serializers import SubscriptionSerializer

>>> class SubscriptionViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
...     queryset = Subscription.objects.all()
...     serializer_class = SubscriptionSerializer
...     permission_classes = (CanSubscribe,)
...     filter_class = SubscriptionFilter

```

The only thing we have clue about - it is somehow related to the
subscription to our service.

But it does not tell us:

1. What exactly does this class do?
2. How to use it?

We need to keep framework documentation close to the sources to figure
this out.

![REST Framework Method Flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dry-python/dry-python.github.io/develop/slides/pics/method-flowchart.png)

After a few hours of digging, we will figure out there are about 17
different ways to interact with this view.

When we go to the `SubscriptionSerializer` class, we expect to see there
a mapping of fields from the database model to the JSON object.

And we actually do.

```pycon

>>> from rest_framework.fields import IntegerField
>>> from rest_framework.serializers import Serializer

>>> class SubscriptionSerializer(Serializer):
...     category_id = IntegerField()
...     price_id = IntegerField()

```

But in addition we see this method:

```pycon

>>> def recreate_nested_writable_fields(self, instance):
...     for field, values in self.writable_fields_to_recreate():
...         related_manager = getattr(instance, field)
...         related_manager.all().delete()
...         for data in values:
...             obj = related_manager.model.objects.create(
...                 to=instance, **data)
...             related_manager.add(obj)

```

Once again we have no idea...

1. What was the actual reason to put this method there?
2. Which one of the 17 ways to interact with the view does it affect?
3. What framework state it expects to work with?

It will take a few hours more to answer this questions.

## Conclusion

In both projects built with `micro` and `macro` frameworks we end up
with actually the **same** situation:

1. Our code is fragile. We afraid to change it.
2. It is hard to reason about.
3. It is time-consuming to work with it.

But there is a solution for it!

## Business logic

The main problem with both approaches - it is completely unclear what
the application actually does. What problems it is trying to solve?

Most frameworks are busy with forms, serializers, transport layers,
field mappings. And all these implementation details are not the right
abstractions for decision making.

Usually, our first thought will be moving our business logic from the
view into a function.

```pycon

>>> def buy_subscription(category_id, price_id, user):
...
...     category = find_category(category_id)
...     price = find_price(price_id)
...     profile = find_profile(user)
...     if profile.balance < price.cost:
...         raise ValueError
...     decrease_balance(profile, price.cost)
...     save_profile(profile)
...     expires = calculate_period(price.period)
...     subscription = create_subscription(profile, category, expires)
...     notification = send_notification('subscribe', profile, category)

```

The author definitely has a few good points to write code this way.

It is short, has clear names and intent.

If you enjoy writing code like this, stop reading and go write it. I'm
serious!

But we see a few disadvantages in it.

1. Growth problem. In real life, functions like this will have ~50
   lines of code, a lot of variables and nested `if`
   statements. Eventually, a programmer will decide to hide its
   complexity somewhere.
   - Convert to the object. The main intent is hiding ~50 variables in
     ~50 object attributes. This will improve the readability of the
     main method. But will harm the understanding of where data came
     from.
   - Mixins. At some point, we will like to reuse parts of our
     business logic. A mixin is the most common way to make code with
     classes reusable. But it will lead to even more implicit source
     of data. Attributes appear from nowhere.
2. Top-down architecture. We call functions directly. They call other
   low level functions directly. Our business logic has a very high
   coupling with the way we talk to the database, SMS gateway or
   notification server. This approach has zero flexibility.

There is a better way.

## DSL

Wouldn't it be nice if we can just read business logic as it was
intended?

```pycon

>>> from stories import story, arguments

>>> class Subscription:
...
...     @story
...     @arguments("category_id", "price_id")
...     def buy(I):
...
...         I.find_category
...         I.find_price
...         I.find_profile
...         I.check_balance
...         I.persist_payment
...         I.persist_subscription
...         I.send_subscription_notification

```

Wouldn't it be nice to have a clear understandable state?

```pycon

>>> ctx
Subscription.buy:
  find_category
  check_price
  check_purchase (PromoCode.validate)
    find_code (skipped)
  check_balance
    find_profile

Context:
  category_id = 1318           # Story argument
  user = <User: 3292>          # Story argument
  category = <Category: 1318>  # Set by Subscription.find_category

```

Wouldn't it be nice to know which business scenario was executed by
every line in the tests?

Wouldn't it be nice to see the same details in the debug toolbar?

Wouldn't it be nice to have it when production fails?
