### BREAKING CHANGES

- The old codebase was removed. The library was redesigned from scratch. A lot
  of existed functionality was removed. Contrib integrations was moved to
  separate repositories. The goal of the library stays the same. Allow to
  express domain knowledge inside codebase with minimal friction. The approach
  we took is similar with the old one but most of design flaws was fixed in new
  version.
