The business transaction DSL
============================

``stories`` is a business transaction DSL.  It provides a simple way
to define a complex business transaction that includes processing over
many steps and by many different objects.  It makes error handling a
primary concern by taking a “`Railway Oriented Programming`_” approach
to capturing and returning errors from any step in the transaction.

``stories`` is based on the following ideas:

* A business transaction is a series of operations where any can fail
  and stop the processing.

* A business transaction can describe its steps on an abstract level
  without being coupled to any details about how individual operations
  work.

* A business transaction doesn’t have any state.

* Each operation shouldn’t accumulate state, instead it should receive
  an input and return an output without causing any side-effects.

* The only interface of an operation is ``ctx``.

* Each operation provides a meaningful piece of functionality and can
  be reused.

* Errors in any operation should be easily caught and handled as part
  of the normal application flow.

Example
=======

``stories`` provide a simple way to define a complex business scenario
that include many processing steps.

.. code:: python

    from stories import story, arguments, Success, Failure, Result

    class Subscribe:

        @story
        @arguments('category_id', 'user_id')
        def buy(I):

            I.find_category
            I.find_profile
            I.check_balance
            I.persist_subscription
            I.show_subscription

        def find_category(self, ctx):

            category = Category.objects.get(id=ctx.category_id)
            return Success(category=category)

        def find_profile(self, ctx):

            profile = Profile.objects.get(user_id=ctx.user_id)
            return Success(profile=profile)

        def check_balance(self, ctx):

            if ctx.category.cost < ctx.profile.balance:
                return Success()
            else:
                return Failure()

        def persist_subscription(self, ctx):

            subscription = Subscription(ctx.category, ctx.profile)
            subscription.save()
            return Success(subscription=subscription)

        def show_subscription(self, ctx):

            return Result(ctx.subscription)

.. code:: pycon

    >>> Subscribe().buy(category_id=1, user_id=1)
    <Subscription object>
    >>> _

This code style allow you clearly separate actual business scenario
from implementation details.

.. note::

    ``stories`` library was heavily inspired by dry-transaction_ ruby
    gem.
