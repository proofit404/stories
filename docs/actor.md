## Story could define an actor

Complicated business process is always a composition of smaller business
processes. Sometimes these smaller processes would be executed by different
persons in real life. Or by people with different roles. To make it easier for
the reader of your code to understand who is `I` in current story you could
define an actor as part of the story class.

Our general advice would be **always** define story actors even if you system
only has single role at the moment. This small change would give right context
for the reader. And please **do not call it User**. It is always a user.
